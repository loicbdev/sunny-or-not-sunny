To make this little weather application work, you need OpenWeatherMap, a third-party API that'll let us fetch the weather data.

Go to https://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up and create your own account.

After you are done, click on the API option on the Navigation bar. You'll see different options like Current Weather Data, Hourly 4 hour forecasts, 16 day forecasts, and others. These are API endpoints that you'll need to fetch the data.

You also need an API key to call these APIs. To get your API key, click on your username in the top right corner, and then on "my API keys".

Create an API key if it doesn't already exist.

In your main app folder, create a file called ".env". This is an environment variable file that will contain all your API endpoints and keys.
